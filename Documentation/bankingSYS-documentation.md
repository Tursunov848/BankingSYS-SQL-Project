## 8. Challenges Faced
- Column/type mismatches during data generation  
- Deciding schema before implementation took time  
- Once tasks were clear, execution was smooth  

## 9. Lessons Learned
- Importance of alignment before development  
- Deep focus on details early saves hours later  
- Breaking work into clear responsibilities accelerates success
